# Self-Improving Coding LLM

**Overview:**
This project aims to develop a self-improving system for a Coding Large Language Model (LLM) that iteratively refines its code generation capabilities through testing and fine-tuning. The system will generate code, test it against predefined requirements, and use the successful code to fine-tune the LLM, continuously improving its accuracy and performance.

**Key Components:**
1. **Code Interpreter:** A code interpreter that can generate project files, populate them with code generated by the LLM, and execute tests against the generated code.
2. **Test Suite:** A comprehensive set of tests and testing frameworks to validate the correctness and functionality of the generated code.
3. **Evaluation and Iteration:** A module that analyzes the test results, identifies areas for improvement, and modifies the LLM's responses accordingly.
4. **Fine-tuning Pipeline:** A pipeline that fine-tunes the LLM on the successful code samples, incorporating the improvements into the model's knowledge.

**Planned Approach:**
1. Set up the code interpreter with an initial Coding LLM (e.g., CodeLLaMA-3-70b).
2. Generate code and tests for a set of coding problems (e.g., LeetCode questions).
3. Execute the tests and evaluate the results, keeping track of successful and unsuccessful attempts.
4. For successful attempts, store the code, problem context, and LLM response for fine-tuning.
5. Fine-tune the LLM on the collected data, incorporating the improvements.
6. Repeat the process, iteratively refining the LLM's capabilities.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
The performance of the system will be measured by tracking the success rate of the LLM's code generation attempts. For each coding problem, the system will be given 5 attempts. A point will be awarded for each successful attempt. After trying all problems, the performance will be calculated as n/m, where n is the number of successful attempts, and m is the total number of attempts.

The performance will be compared across three stages:
1. The original LLM (baseline)
2. The output of the iterative process (without fine-tuning)
3. The fine-tuned LLM

**Potential Implications:**
While the primary goal is to improve the LLM's coding abilities, this iterative process may lead to emergent properties, such as enhanced reasoning skills or improved performance in related tasks.

**Estimation:**
- Research and planning: 2 weeks
- Architecture and design: 3 weeks
- Implementation: 8-10 weeks
- Testing and evaluation: 4 weeks

**Total Estimation:** 17-19 weeks

This project leverages the power of Large Language Models and iterative fine-tuning to create a self-improving system for code generation. By continuously testing and refining the LLM's outputs, the system aims to enhance the model's accuracy and capabilities, potentially leading to emergent properties and broader improvements.
